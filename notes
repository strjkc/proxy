🧠 Python Networking & Sockets
📌 Beginner-friendly tutorial

👉 Python Socket Programming (guide) — a solid intro to TCP sockets, servers, clients, and how Python’s socket API works.
Great for grasping the basics: how connections work, how to send/receive bytes, etc.

🌀 Async I/O with Python
📌 Official Python docs

👉 asyncio streams documentation — shows how to build TCP clients/servers with asyncio, the primitives (StreamReader/StreamWriter) you’ll use in your project.
This is exactly the level you’ll need for writing your proxy with async networking.

🌐 HTTP Protocol Deep Dives
📌 Build from scratch

👉 HTTP from scratch with Python sockets — a guide (blog) that walks through sending/parsing raw HTTP requests and responses.
Useful for learning how HTTP messages are structured and processed under the hood.

🧩 Proxies & HTTP Concepts
📌 Concept overview

👉 Proxies, reverse proxies, load balancers — explains what they are and the differences between forward vs reverse proxies at a high level.
Good for understanding why proxies exist and what they’re used for.

📚 Web Server Foundations
📌 Web server internals

👉 Building a web server from scratch (series) — although not a proxy tutorial, it teaches how to design and implement HTTP handling from first principles.
That background will give you deeper context before you start proxy code.

🎥 (Optional) Video Resource
📌 Async server explained

There’s a YouTube tutorial showing how to write an async server socket in Python — useful if you like seeing code in action.

🔭 Extra advanced options (if you want them)

Twisted networking framework — if later you want to explore another event-driven approach in Python.

Squid proxy — a real world C++ proxy you can study as reference.

🧠 Suggested study order

Python sockets basics — server, client, recv/send.

asyncio streams — listen, accept, read/write concurrently.

HTTP structure & parsing — requests, headers, bodies.

Proxy concepts — forward vs reverse, routing.

Build tiny echo server/client → simple HTTP parser → proxy basics.
